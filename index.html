    <H1>Little Seed Library</H1>
    <p>This is an open source wildflower meadow ecosystem focused on education and application. Wildflower meadows are much more sustainable for the environment and beautiful. They take some work on the front end to set up but they are largely self sustaining afterwords</p>
    <h2>Information you'll need to get started:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>an aerial view with compass of the property.</li>
        <li>an understanding of how much sun hits each section of the property.</li>
        <li>Your <a href="https://www.americanmeadows.com/wildflower-seeds">region</a> will determine what wildflowers grow best and support your local pollinators</li>
        <li>Where are your spigots for irrigation?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Start with a Plan:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Organize your seeds by their sun needs</li>
        <li>Mark out your irrigation</li>
        <li>Sketch our your seed Library</li>
    </ol>
